<!-- Bootstrap is built on the 12 colm system, namely, for every row, there are 12 colmuns
that you can make your containing elements can occupy, you can make a card occupy 6 colms like
in first card! 

Formatting of boostrap should always look like this

container
  row
    col

The only things that won't fit properly within a 12 colm grid.

      <div class="card col">
        Card
      </div>

      <div class="card col-auto offset-3">
        Card
      </div>

- card col will have a number that is evenly distrubuted based on the hardcoded ratios, so if it's like col-2, col-6, col will = 4
- card col-auto will try it's best to make sure there's only enough space for the card to wrap around the elements within the card.
(This will come out to have a decminal width it seems)
-Offset offsets the card 3 colms over.

Bootstrap will try to fit everything on one line, however the moment we go above 12, it will push the element to the next row under.



Breakpoints

      <div class="card col-6 col-md-1 col-sm-10">
        Card
      </div>

So basically for large screens, it will make the colm width 1. 
For small screens, the colm width will be 10.
Everything else will default down to col-6.

For basically all pre-set bootstrap classes there is a breakpoint version of them that can
be called like this

class="[premade thing] col-[screensize]-[size]



Setting Custom Colm Count per Row.

    <div class="row row-cols-2">

Notice how it's row-cols-2, not row-col-2, the syntax requires this.



Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)

a "map" [in Sass] refers to a data structure that stores key-value pairs. 
In Sass, a map is a collection of related data where each value is 
associated with a unique key.

$colors: (
  primary: #3498db,
  secondary: #2ecc71,
  accent: #e74c3c
);

Key-value pairs defintion:
i.e primary = key
    #3498db = value.
