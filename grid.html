      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; /* Spesifies the colm width, 1 new arguement = 1 new colm */
      grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr 2fr; /* Spesifies the row height, 1 new arguement = 1 new row */
      gap: 5px;
    }
      /* Interestingly, when you call display: grid by itself, it creates a 1x1 grid as a standard.

      You have to call a div for the div to occupy a row/colm 
      and you have to ensure there are enough rows/colms to occupy
      (in order for your boxes to show up) <-- (as .card
      is not (and should not) be spesifying a fixed height/width)
      
      This allows for flush and consistent div sizes across the website and using something
      like fr or em allows for easier responsiveness.

      Fr represents 1 part (or fraction) of the avaiable space (i.e the webpage). 
      For instance in grid-template-rows: 5fr 1fr 2fr; we have a total of 8fr. Meaning that
      the first row takes up 5/8, the 2nd 1/8 and so on (NOT COUNTING GAP!) and because divs by default
      are only as big as needed (to ensure everything inside the div fits) this can become a little conveluted.
